# valheim-imacheater-presentation

This is a billingual presentation about this [Valheim Multiplayer Cheat Tool Project](https://github.com/marcos10soares/valheim-imacheater) using Vue.js and Slider.js.

The package i18n was not used on purpose, as for such a simple application there was no need for it.

Each componenet in "Components/Slides" is a self contained slide.
